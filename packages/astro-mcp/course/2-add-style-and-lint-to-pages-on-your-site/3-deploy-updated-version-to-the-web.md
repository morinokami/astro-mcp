## Publish your changes to the web

If you've followed our setup in Unit 1, you can publish your changes to your live website through Netlify.

When you are happy with the way your preview looks, **commit** your changes to your online repository at GitHub.

1. In VS Code, preview the files that have changed since your last commit to GitHub.
   - Go to the **Source Control tab** in the left menu. It should have a small "3" displayed.
   - You should see `index.astro`, `about.astro`, and `blog.astro` listed as files that have changed.
2. Enter a commit message (e.g. "Added two new pages - about and blog") in the text box, and press <kbd>Ctrl + Enter</kbd> (macOS: <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜ + Enter</kbd>) to commit the change to your current workspace.
3. Click the button to <kbd>Sync Changes</kbd> to GitHub.
4. After waiting a few minutes, visit your Netlify URL to verify that your changes are published live.

> **ðŸ’¡ Commit and deploy regularly**
>
> Follow these steps every time you pause working! Your changes will be updated in your GitHub repository. If you've deployed to a Netlify website, it will be rebuilt and republished.
