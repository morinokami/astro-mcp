Now that you have built pages using `.astro` files, it's time to make some blog posts using `.md` files!

> - Make a new folder and create a new post

## Create your first `.md` file

1. Create a new directory at `src/pages/posts/`.
2. Add a new (empty) file `post-1.md` inside your new `/posts/` folder.
3. Look for this page in your browser preview by adding `/posts/post-1` to the end of your existing preview URL. (e.g. `http://localhost:4321/posts/post-1`)
4. Change the browser preview URL to view `/posts/post-2` instead. (This is a page you have not yet created.)
   Note the different output when previewing an "empty" page, and one that doesn't exist. This will help you troubleshoot in the future.
