Here, you will connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. Netlify will use that project to build and deploy your site live on the web every time you commit a change to your code.

> This course will use **Netlify**, but you are welcome to use your preferred hosting service for deploying your site to the internet.

## Create a new Netlify site

1. Create a free account at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) if you do not already have one.
   Make a note of your username. You will view your dashboard and any sites you create at `https://app.netlify.com/teams/username`
2. Click <kbd>Add new site</kbd> > <kbd>Import an existing project</kbd>.
   You will be asked to connect to a Git provider. Choose GitHub and follow the steps onscreen to authenticate your GitHub account. Then, choose your Astro project's GitHub repository from the list provided.
3. At the final step, Netlify will show you your app's site settings. The defaults should be correct for your Astro project, so you can scroll down and click <kbd>Deploy site</kbd>.

Congratulations, you have an Astro website!

## Change your project name

On your site's overview page in Netlify, you will see your randomly-generated project name, and your website URL of the form `https://project-name-123456.netlify.app`. You can change your project name to something more memorable, and this will automatically update your URL.

## Visit your new website
