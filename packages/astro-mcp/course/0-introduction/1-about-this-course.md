# About this Course

## What do I need to know to get started?

If you have some basic familiarity with **HTML**, **Markdown**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**, then you're totally good to go! You'll be able to complete the entire tutorial just by following the instructions. Astro is for everyone! 🧑‍🚀 👩‍🚀 👨‍🚀

You will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com) (or similar) account for publishing your project to the web.
