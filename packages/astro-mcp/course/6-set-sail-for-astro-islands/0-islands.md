# Check in: Unit 6 - Astro Islands

Now that you have a fully functioning blog, it's time to add some interactive islands to your site!

## Looking ahead

In this unit, you'll use **Astro islands** to bring frontend framework components into your Astro site.

You will:

- Add a UI framework, Preact, to your Astro project
- Use Preact to create an interactive greeting component
- Learn when you might _not_ choose islands for interactivity
