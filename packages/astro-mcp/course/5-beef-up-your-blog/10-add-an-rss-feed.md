## Install Astro's RSS package

Astro provides a custom package to quickly add an RSS feed to your website.

This official package generates a non-HTML document with information about all of your blog posts that can be read by **feed readers** like Feedly, The Old Reader, and more. This document is updated every time your site is rebuilt.

Individuals can subscribe to your feed in a feed reader, and receive a notification when you publish a new blog post on your site, making it a popular blog feature.

1. In your terminal, quit the Astro development server (<kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>) and run the following command to install Astro's RSS package.

```shell
npm install @astrojs/rss
```

2. Restart the dev server to begin working on your Astro project again.

```shell
npm run dev
```
