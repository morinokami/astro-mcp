# Check in: Unit 5 - Astro API

Now that you have some blog posts, it's time to use Astro's API to work with your files!

## Looking ahead

In this unit, you'll supercharge your blog with an index page, tag pages, and an RSS feed.

Along the way, you'll learn how to use:

- `import.meta.glob()` to access data from files in your project
- `getStaticPaths()` to create multiple pages (routes) at once
- The Astro RSS package to create an RSS feed
