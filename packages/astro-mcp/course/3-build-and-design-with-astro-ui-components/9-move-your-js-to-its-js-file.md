> - Move your JavaScript to its `.js` file

### Importing a `.js` file

Instead of writing your JavaScript directly on each page, you can move the contents of your `<script>` tag into its own `.js` file in your project.

1. Create `src/scripts/menu.js` (you will have to create a new `/scripts/` folder) and move your JavaScript into it.

    ```js title="src/scripts/menu.js"
    document.querySelector('.hamburger').addEventListener('click', () => {
      document.querySelector('.nav-links').classList.toggle('expanded');
    });
    ```

2. Replace the contents of the `<script>` tag on `index.astro` with the following file import:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={7} del={3-5}
      <Footer />
      <script>
        document.querySelector('.hamburger')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
          document.querySelector('.nav-links')?.classList.toggle('expanded');
        });

        import "../scripts/menu.js";
      </script>
    </body>
    ```

3. Check your browser preview again at a smaller size and verify that the hamburger menu still opens and closes your navigation links. 


4. Add the same `<script>` with import to your other two pages, `about.astro` and `blog.astro` and verify that you have a responsive, interactive header on each page.

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro & src/pages/blog.astro" ins={2-4}
      <Footer />
      <script>
        import "../scripts/menu.js";
      </script>
    </body>
    ```

> **ðŸ’¡ Takeaways**
>
> You had previously used some JavaScript to build parts of your site:
>
> - Defining your page title and heading dynamically
> - Mapping through a list of skills on the About page
> - Conditionally displaying HTML elements
>
> Those commands are all executed at build time to create static HTML for your site, and then the code is "thrown away." 
>
> **The JavaScript in a `<script>` tag is sent to the browser**, and is available to run, based on user interactions like refreshing a page or toggling an input.
