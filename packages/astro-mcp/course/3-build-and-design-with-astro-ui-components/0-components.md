# Check in: Lesson 3 - Components

Now that you have `.astro` and `.md` files generating entire pages on your website, it's time to make and reuse smaller bits of HTML with Astro components!

## Looking ahead

In this unit, you'll learn how to create **Astro components** to reuse code for common elements across your website. 

You'll build:
- A Navigation component that presents a menu of links to your pages 
- A Footer component to include at the bottom of each page
- A Social Media component, used in the Footer, that links to profile pages
- An interactive Hamburger component to toggle the Navigation on mobile

Along the way, you'll use CSS and JavaScript to build a responsive design that reacts to screen sizes and user input.
